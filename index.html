											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello everyone, my name is Tommy Ngo but most of my mates call me Thomas. I was born in Australia, but I was raised in Vietnam due to family circumstance. In total I stayed in Vietnam for 7-8 eight year thanks to that I‚Äôm fluent in both English and Vietnamese. I graduated from Simonds catholic college 2 years ago in 2020. After high school I decided to study biotechnology at RMIT, however I found it was quite boring and it wasn‚Äôt for me. So, I drop out thus I‚Äôm studying IT this year. Like most of teenagers my interest is gaming and watch movie/anime. Some of my favorited game The Witcher 3, Elder Scroll online and Minecraft, if you haven‚Äôt realized already my favorite genres of games is RPG (role playing game). However, I am very into Elden ring at the moments which is a surprisingly hard game and sometime frustrated but making it worthwhile when you able to beat a boss. I don‚Äôt really have a favorite movie, but I do have a favorite trilogy, lord of the ring and the hobbit, as you can see, I mostly like fantasy and adventure stuffs. As for anime my favorite of all time is Naruto (a bit basic), which is about an orphan who try to get recognition from his peers by becoming the leader of his village. I guessed it my favorite because growing up as a kid I have always watch it and some of the moments have taught valuable life lesson. Another interest/hobby of mine that I haven‚Äôt really got to practice is traveling, back in 2019 I was given the opportunity to travel to Japan for a school trip and it was the best experience I have ever felts. Within three days there I have already felts in love with the culture, peoples, foods, sceneries and everything they offers, from there I just want to experience what other country and culture got to offer as well. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt travel much for the past 3 year because of covid however I‚Äôm already planning trip such as Japan again, Canada and Korea for this year when border start easing up. I‚Äôm also very outgoing so don‚Äôt be afraid to approach me or talk to me üòä. </p>
										<h2> Intrest in I.T</h2>
										<p>Like most people my interest in IT come from playing games, surfing the web and just being on the internet itself. IT appeal to me because of the variety of jobs in the field that they offer, not only that but you can be quite flexible with your career choices such as being technical writer, web developer, IT director and so much more. Since the job market for technology is still growing there will many more job opportunity in near future. These jobs will require high skill level and training which can get very stressful, but it is compensated with very good pay which another reason for my interest in IT.</p>
										<p>I didn‚Äôt really have any experience with IT until I was 12-year-old. But the person that got me really into IT was a youtuber name Michael Reeves, who is know for his ‚Äúcomedy-tech‚Äù video. Where he asks his viewer to give him suggestion to build something such as a gas-powered fishing pole or a scream powered microwave. Watching him make me realize that IT is not all about data and sitting in front of a computer for 24/7 but it also can be fun and practical, by building the thing you want and programing what you want it to do.</p>
										
										<p>There is multiple reason why I choose to study at RMIT, the first reason is that is very accessible since the campus in located in the CBD getting to and from there is very easy. From what I heard, people says that RMIT is the perfect university for computing and technology, it is also in the name. I also have mates from RMIT recommended me as well, they said it easy to make friends and just have a great vibe in general.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>A web designer is someone who builds and create website or web pages with the combination of things such as visual design elements including text, photos, graphics, animations and videos. They could make an entire new website or make adjustment to an existing page. The responsibility of this position is to keep the consistency of online content and function with the brand values and direction, also to improve on their website imagery, copy and content managed functions. What standout to me in this position is that is in the CBD, which is very convenient for me to travel to, along with some other benefits as well such as bring your dog to work.</p>
									<p>This position is required some experience as a web designer or similar role and front-end coding skills such as HTML and CSS. It is also preferable to have some experience in the salesforce platform. Working knowledge of social media, e-commerce and mobile web is also needed. Lastly you need to have a great communication and interpersonal skill as you will be working in a team most of the time.</p>
									
									<p>Currently I only have little knowledge of front-end coding, however I am great at communicating with other people, but this can be improved on. I am also a hard worker in which I would put in extra effort and time in stuff I do really enjoy doing.</p>
									
									<p>To obtain all these skills and experience I will need to graduate from RMIT with a Bachelor‚Äôs of I.T. By the end of the degree, I will be able to learn how to code HTML and CSS. During that time my communication skill will also be improved through group project and activates.</p>
